    <b>Greetings!</b><br/>
    
    <p>My name is Janne. I have been dabbling with creative works since I was a teenager. I mostly do graphic design and music, with small amount of visual art and video editing sprinkled in. This site is intended mostly intended to display my portfolio for (future) customers. You will find all the necessary links in the header!</p>

    <p>My other hobbies include mostly video gaming (nowadays preferrably (japanese) rhythm games such as IIDX) and level design for my favorite games on an amateur level.</p>   
       
      <p>Whilst I have (and at the time of writing still am) learned web development, it is still hard for me, so I have borrowed the codebase from <a href="https://eggramen.neocities.org/main">EGGRAMEN, all credits go to them.</a> I promise I will rewrite the code at a later date with my own code!.</p>
      <p>If you happen to be seeing this site from my neocities link, I also have a mirror on it hosted on <a href="https://gardenofvegetable.github.io">Github</a>. </p>
