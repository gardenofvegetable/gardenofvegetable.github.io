      <p>These were made for my awesome girlfriend, who makes techno. I recommend you check out her music from <a href="https://shakunetsu.bandcamp.com/">here</a>! All of them follow a cold or a more moody color scheme as requested to fit the sounds of the releases.</p>

      <p>I helped my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kamikazegirls.jp">friend</a> to design these shirts which are based on the rhythm game series Pop'n Music. On the second design, it features a drawing of one the game mascots. As of December 2023, only the first design is on sale, which you can buy from <a href="https://kamikazegirls.jp/collections/mto-shirts/products/popn-anxiety-black-shirt?variant=44208279716058">here</a>. It comes in both black and white.</p>

      <p>These two (and soon a third one!) posters I made for my friend's <a href="https://datafruits.fm/shows/craft_radio-w-host-synkretic">radio show on datafruits.fm</a>. For the first one, I was given the request to make the poster autumn themed. The second one I had completely free reign over, which resulted in a cold and unfamiliar feeling picture.</p>

      <p>This cover I made for the Scottish rapper <a href="https://soundcloud.com/elcammgguod">elcammgguod</a>. The cover pays homage to the late rapper Capo, who's discography inspired elcammgguod's music and imagery, which also shows in in the album cover and it's general themes. The album has garnered thousands of listens across both Soundcloud and Spotify, making it one of the more known releases I have been able help with.</p>

      <p>The two cover above were made for my friend <a href="https://soundcloud.com/zyber47/">Zyber</a> for his mixtape Full of Myself and it's single. The cover art for the mixtape reflects its braggadocious themes and lyrics and also pays homage to the mixtapes of 2010s with their wild style. Both of these were part of my more earlier works, which can be seen in certain parts such as the text choices, but it is nice to see where you have come from.</p>
